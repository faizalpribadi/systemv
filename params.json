It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies Requirements\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n* `Linux OS 64-bit`\r\n\r\n* `systemd libraries is already installed`\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\n* `$ git clone https://github.com/faizalpribadi/systemv.git`\r\n\r\n* `$ cd systemv && ./configure`\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage \r\n=====\r\n\r\n* `copy files of {systemv.socket,systemv.service} to /etc/systemd/system`\r\n\r\n* `systemctl enable systemv.socket`\r\n\r\n* `systemctl start systemv.socket`\r\n\r\n* `check systemv is already running & loaded with this command [systemctl | grep systemv]`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
